## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Parser Architecture
**Decision:** Modular parser design with separate parsers for different SSIS components
**Rationale:** Maintains separation of concerns, enables independent testing, and allows for easy extension
**Implementation:** DTSXParser orchestrates ComponentParser, ConnectionParser, VariableParser, and ConfigParser

### 2. Data Structures
**Decision:** Use dataclasses for structured data representation
**Rationale:** Provides type safety, clear structure, and easy serialization
**Implementation:** SSISPackage, ParsingResult, ConfigEntry, ConfigFile dataclasses

### 3. Error Handling
**Decision:** Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
**Rationale:** Essential for debugging and user experience in CLI tool
**Implementation:** Try-catch blocks with specific error messages and logging

### 4. Namespace Handling
**Decision:** Robust namespace handling for SSIS XML elements
**Rationale:** SSIS uses multiple XML namespaces that must be handled correctly
**Implementation:** Namespace dictionary with fallback to non-namespaced attributes

### 5. Configuration Management
**Decision:** Integrated configuration parsing with environment variable support
**Rationale:** SSIS packages often use external configuration files and environment variables
**Implementation:** ConfigParser with environment variable detection and encrypted value handling

### 6. Data Flow Mapping
**Decision:** Rule-based transformation system with component-specific code generation
**Rationale:** Provides structured, maintainable, and extensible transformation logic
**Implementation:** DataFlowMapper with transformation rules for each component type

### 7. Script Generation
**Decision:** Template-based generation with integrated data flow mapping
**Rationale:** Ensures consistent output while leveraging advanced transformation logic
**Implementation:** PythonScriptGenerator with DataFlowMapper integration
