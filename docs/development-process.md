  - Installed dependencies and configured editable package installation
  - Created basic unit test for CLI functionality
  - Updated .gitignore with standard Python and IDE ignore rules

**Key Decisions:**
- Used Python 3.10+ for modern language features and compatibility
- Chose Click for CLI framework due to simplicity and feature richness
- Implemented modular architecture with separate parsers for different SSIS components
- Used dataclasses for structured data representation

**Technical Challenges:**
- Initial Python version was 3.7 (too old) - upgraded to 3.10 via Homebrew
